"Corporations use advanced statistical models to boost profits all the time. Our mission is to provide the same opportunity for social non-profit organizations, who may not have the technical expertise and resources necessary for a dedicated analytics team, to boost their reach, operational efficiency, and impact, to channel the power of data in the service of healthcare."
